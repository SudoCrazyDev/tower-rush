# Game changelog

Releases up to 2.3.0 are documented per release in `docs/features/` (see `docs/features/ROADMAP.md`); tags `v1.1.0` to `v2.2.0` stay as game history. From here, tags are `game-vX.Y.Z`.

## 2.3.0
- Hosted as its own static Worker on game.crownnkeep.com; talks to the API at api.crownnkeep.com.
- Sends `X-Client-Version` (WebSockets: `v=`). When the API answers 426, or `/api/config` reports a `minClient` above this version, shows a "New version available" prompt with an Update button.
